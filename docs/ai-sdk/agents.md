# Agents

Agents are **large language models (LLMs)** using **tools** in a **loop** to accomplish tasks.

Each component plays a distinct role:

- **LLMs** process input (text) and decide what action to take next
- **Tools** extend what the model can do beyond text generation (e.g. reading files, calling APIs, writing to databases)
- **Loop** orchestrates execution through:
  - **Context management** - Maintaining conversation history and deciding what the model sees (input) at each step
  - **Stopping conditions** - Determining when the loop (task) is complete

## Building Blocks

You combine these fundamental components to create increasingly sophisticated systems:

### Single-Step Generation

One call to an LLM to get a response. Use this for straightforward tasks like classification or text generation.

```ts
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const result = await generateText({
  model: 'openai/gpt-4o',
  prompt: 'Classify this sentiment: "I love this product!"',
});
```

### Tool Usage

Enhance LLM capabilities through tools that provide access to external systems. Tools can read data to augment context (like fetching files or querying databases) or write data to take actions (like sending emails or updating records).

```ts
import { generateText, tool } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

const result = await generateText({
  model: 'openai/gpt-4o',
  prompt: 'What is the weather in San Francisco?',
  tools: {
    weather: tool({
      description: 'Get the weather in a location',
      parameters: z.object({
        location: z.string().describe('The location to get the weather for'),
      }),
      execute: async ({ location }) => ({
        location,
        temperature: 72 + Math.floor(Math.random() * 21) - 10,
      }),
    }),
  },
});

console.log(result.toolResults);
```

### Multi-Step Tool Usage (Agents)

For complex problems, an LLM can make multiple tool calls across multiple steps. The model decides the order and number of tool calls based on the task.

```ts
import { generateText, stepCountIs, tool } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

const result = await generateText({
  model: 'openai/gpt-4o',
  prompt: 'What is the weather in San Francisco in celsius?',
  tools: {
    weather: tool({
      description: 'Get the weather in a location (in Fahrenheit)',
      parameters: z.object({
        location: z.string().describe('The location to get the weather for'),
      }),
      execute: async ({ location }) => ({
        location,
        temperature: 72 + Math.floor(Math.random() * 21) - 10,
      }),
    }),
    convertFahrenheitToCelsius: tool({
      description: 'Convert temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius',
      parameters: z.object({
        temperature: z.number().describe('Temperature in Fahrenheit'),
      }),
      execute: async ({ temperature }) => {
        const celsius = Math.round((temperature - 32) * (5 / 9));
        return { celsius };
      },
    }),
  },
  stopWhen: stepCountIs(10), // Stop after maximum 10 steps
});

console.log(result.text); // Output: The weather in San Francisco is currently _°C.
```

The LLM might:

1. Call the `weather` tool to get the temperature in Fahrenheit
2. Call the `convertFahrenheitToCelsius` tool to convert it
3. Generate a text response with the converted temperature

This behavior is flexible - the LLM determines the approach based on its understanding of the task.

## Implementation Approaches

The AI SDK provides two approaches to build agents:

### Agent Class

Object-oriented abstraction that handles the loop for you. Best when you want to:

- Reuse agent configurations
- Minimize boilerplate code
- Build consistent agent behaviors

```ts
import { Experimental_Agent as Agent } from 'ai';

const myAgent = new Agent({
  model: 'openai/gpt-4o',
  tools: {
    // your tools here
  },
  stopWhen: stepCountIs(10), // Continue for up to 10 steps
});

const result = await myAgent.generate({
  prompt: 'Analyze the latest sales data and create a summary report',
});

console.log(result.text);
```

[Learn more about the Agent class](/docs/agents/agent-class).

### Core Functions

Use `generateText` or `streamText` with tools. Choose between:

**Built-in Loop** - Let the SDK manage the execution cycle:

```ts
import { generateText, stepCountIs } from 'ai';

const result = await generateText({
  model: 'openai/gpt-4o',
  prompt: 'Research machine learning trends and provide key insights',
  tools: {
    // your tools here
  },
  stopWhen: stepCountIs(10),
  prepareStep: ({ stepNumber }) => {
    // Modify settings between steps
  },
  onStepFinish: step => {
    // Monitor or save progress
  },
});
```

[Learn more about loop control](/docs/agents/loop-control).

**Manual Loop** - Full control over execution:

```ts
import { generateText, ModelMessage } from 'ai';

const messages: ModelMessage[] = [{ role: 'user', content: '...' }];

let step = 0;
const maxSteps = 10;

while (step < maxSteps) {
  const result = await generateText({
    model: 'openai/gpt-4o',
    messages,
    tools: {
      // your tools here
    },
  });

  messages.push(...result.response.messages);

  if (result.text) {
    break; // Stop when model generates text
  }

  step++;
}
```

## When You Need More Control

Agents are powerful but non-deterministic. When you need reliable, repeatable outcomes, combine tool calling with standard programming patterns:

- Conditional statements for explicit branching
- Functions for reusable logic
- Error handling for robustness
- Explicit control flow for predictability

This approach gives you the benefits of AI while maintaining control over critical paths.

# Workflow Patterns

Combine the building blocks from the [overview](/docs/agents/overview) with these patterns to add structure and reliability to your agents:

- [Sequential Processing](#sequential-processing-chains) - Steps executed in order
- [Parallel Processing](#parallel-processing) - Independent tasks run simultaneously
- [Evaluation/Feedback Loops](#evaluator-optimizer) - Results checked and improved iteratively
- [Orchestration](#orchestrator-worker) - Coordinating multiple components
- [Routing](#routing) - Directing work based on context

## Choose Your Approach

Consider these key factors:

- **Flexibility vs Control** - How much freedom does the LLM need vs how tightly you must constrain its actions?
- **Error Tolerance** - What are the consequences of mistakes in your use case?
- **Cost Considerations** - More complex systems typically mean more LLM calls and higher costs
- **Maintenance** - Simpler architectures are easier to debug and modify

**Start with the simplest approach that meets your needs**. Add complexity only when required by:

1. Breaking down tasks into clear steps
2. Adding tools for specific capabilities
3. Implementing feedback loops for quality control
4. Introducing multiple agents for complex workflows

Let's look at examples of these patterns in action.

## Patterns with Examples

These patterns, adapted from [Anthropic's guide on building effective agents](https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents), serve as building blocks you can combine to create comprehensive workflows. Each pattern addresses specific aspects of task execution. Combine them thoughtfully to build reliable solutions for complex problems.

## Sequential Processing (Chains)

The simplest workflow pattern executes steps in a predefined order. Each step's output becomes input for the next step, creating a clear chain of operations. Use this pattern for tasks with well-defined sequences, like content generation pipelines or data transformation processes.

```ts
import { generateText, generateObject } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

async function generateMarketingCopy(input: string) {
  const model = 'openai/gpt-4o';

  // First step: Generate marketing copy
  const { text: copy } = await generateText({
    model,
    prompt: `Write persuasive marketing copy for: ${input}. Focus on benefits and emotional appeal.`,
  });

  // Perform quality check on copy
  const { object: qualityMetrics } = await generateObject({
    model,
    schema: z.object({
      hasCallToAction: z.boolean(),
      emotionalAppeal: z.number().min(1).max(10),
      clarity: z.number().min(1).max(10),
    }),
    prompt: `Evaluate this marketing copy for:
    1. Presence of call to action (true/false)
    2. Emotional appeal (1-10)
    3. Clarity (1-10)

    Copy to evaluate: ${copy}`,
  });

  // If quality check fails, regenerate with more specific instructions
  if (
    !qualityMetrics.hasCallToAction ||
    qualityMetrics.emotionalAppeal < 7 ||
    qualityMetrics.clarity < 7
  ) {
    const { text: improvedCopy } = await generateText({
      model,
      prompt: `Rewrite this marketing copy with:
      ${!qualityMetrics.hasCallToAction ? '- A clear call to action' : ''}
      ${qualityMetrics.emotionalAppeal < 7 ? '- Stronger emotional appeal' : ''}
      ${qualityMetrics.clarity < 7 ? '- Improved clarity and directness' : ''}

      Original copy: ${copy}`,
    });
    return { copy: improvedCopy, qualityMetrics };
  }

  return { copy, qualityMetrics };
}
```

## Routing

This pattern lets the model decide which path to take through a workflow based on context and intermediate results. The model acts as an intelligent router, directing the flow of execution between different branches of your workflow. Use this when handling varied inputs that require different processing approaches. In the example below, the first LLM call's results determine the second call's model size and system prompt.

```ts
import { generateObject, generateText } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

async function handleCustomerQuery(query: string) {
  const model = 'openai/gpt-4o';

  // First step: Classify the query type
  const { object: classification } = await generateObject({
    model,
    schema: z.object({
      reasoning: z.string(),
      type: z.enum(['general', 'refund', 'technical']),
      complexity: z.enum(['simple', 'complex']),
    }),
    prompt: `Classify this customer query:
    ${query}

    Determine:
    1. Query type (general, refund, or technical)
    2. Complexity (simple or complex)
    3. Brief reasoning for classification`,
  });

  // Route based on classification
  // Set model and system prompt based on query type and complexity
  const { text: response } = await generateText({
    model:
      classification.complexity === 'simple'
        ? 'openai/gpt-4o-mini'
        : 'openai/o4-mini',
    system: {
      general:
        'You are an expert customer service agent handling general inquiries.',
      refund:
        'You are a customer service agent specializing in refund requests. Follow company policy and collect necessary information.',
      technical:
        'You are a technical support specialist with deep product knowledge. Focus on clear step-by-step troubleshooting.',
    }[classification.type],
    prompt: query,
  });

  return { response, classification };
}
```

## Parallel Processing

Break down tasks into independent subtasks that execute simultaneously. This pattern uses parallel execution to improve efficiency while maintaining the benefits of structured workflows. For example, analyze multiple documents or process different aspects of a single input concurrently (like code review).

```ts
import { generateText, generateObject } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

// Example: Parallel code review with multiple specialized reviewers
async function parallelCodeReview(code: string) {
  const model = 'openai/gpt-4o';

  // Run parallel reviews
  const [securityReview, performanceReview, maintainabilityReview] =
    await Promise.all([
      generateObject({
        model,
        system:
          'You are an expert in code security. Focus on identifying security vulnerabilities, injection risks, and authentication issues.',
        schema: z.object({
          vulnerabilities: z.array(z.string()),
          riskLevel: z.enum(['low', 'medium', 'high']),
          suggestions: z.array(z.string()),
        }),
        prompt: `Review this code:
      ${code}`,
      }),

      generateObject({
        model,
        system:
          'You are an expert in code performance. Focus on identifying performance bottlenecks, memory leaks, and optimization opportunities.',
        schema: z.object({
          issues: z.array(z.string()),
          impact: z.enum(['low', 'medium', 'high']),
          optimizations: z.array(z.string()),
        }),
        prompt: `Review this code:
      ${code}`,
      }),

      generateObject({
        model,
        system:
          'You are an expert in code quality. Focus on code structure, readability, and adherence to best practices.',
        schema: z.object({
          concerns: z.array(z.string()),
          qualityScore: z.number().min(1).max(10),
          recommendations: z.array(z.string()),
        }),
        prompt: `Review this code:
      ${code}`,
      }),
    ]);

  const reviews = [
    { ...securityReview.object, type: 'security' },
    { ...performanceReview.object, type: 'performance' },
    { ...maintainabilityReview.object, type: 'maintainability' },
  ];

  // Aggregate results using another model instance
  const { text: summary } = await generateText({
    model,
    system: 'You are a technical lead summarizing multiple code reviews.',
    prompt: `Synthesize these code review results into a concise summary with key actions:
    ${JSON.stringify(reviews, null, 2)}`,
  });

  return { reviews, summary };
}
```

## Orchestrator-Worker

A primary model (orchestrator) coordinates the execution of specialized workers. Each worker optimizes for a specific subtask, while the orchestrator maintains overall context and ensures coherent results. This pattern excels at complex tasks requiring different types of expertise or processing.

```ts
import { generateObject } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

async function implementFeature(featureRequest: string) {
  // Orchestrator: Plan the implementation
  const { object: implementationPlan } = await generateObject({
    model: 'openai/o4-mini',
    schema: z.object({
      files: z.array(
        z.object({
          purpose: z.string(),
          filePath: z.string(),
          changeType: z.enum(['create', 'modify', 'delete']),
        }),
      ),
      estimatedComplexity: z.enum(['low', 'medium', 'high']),
    }),
    system:
      'You are a senior software architect planning feature implementations.',
    prompt: `Analyze this feature request and create an implementation plan:
    ${featureRequest}`,
  });

  // Workers: Execute the planned changes
  const fileChanges = await Promise.all(
    implementationPlan.files.map(async file => {
      // Each worker is specialized for the type of change
      const workerSystemPrompt = {
        create:
          'You are an expert at implementing new files following best practices and project patterns.',
        modify:
          'You are an expert at modifying existing code while maintaining consistency and avoiding regressions.',
        delete:
          'You are an expert at safely removing code while ensuring no breaking changes.',
      }[file.changeType];

      const { object: change } = await generateObject({
        model: 'openai/gpt-4o',
        schema: z.object({
          explanation: z.string(),
          code: z.string(),
        }),
        system: workerSystemPrompt,
        prompt: `Implement the changes for ${file.filePath} to support:
        ${file.purpose}

        Consider the overall feature context:
        ${featureRequest}`,
      });

      return {
        file,
        implementation: change,
      };
    }),
  );

  return {
    plan: implementationPlan,
    changes: fileChanges,
  };
}
```

## Evaluator-Optimizer

Add quality control to workflows with dedicated evaluation steps that assess intermediate results. Based on the evaluation, the workflow proceeds, retries with adjusted parameters, or takes corrective action. This creates robust workflows capable of self-improvement and error recovery.

```ts
import { generateText, generateObject } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

async function translateWithFeedback(text: string, targetLanguage: string) {
  let currentTranslation = '';
  let iterations = 0;
  const MAX_ITERATIONS = 3;

  // Initial translation
  const { text: translation } = await generateText({
    model: 'openai/gpt-4o-mini', // use small model for first attempt
    system: 'You are an expert literary translator.',
    prompt: `Translate this text to ${targetLanguage}, preserving tone and cultural nuances:
    ${text}`,
  });

  currentTranslation = translation;

  // Evaluation-optimization loop
  while (iterations < MAX_ITERATIONS) {
    // Evaluate current translation
    const { object: evaluation } = await generateObject({
      model: 'openai/gpt-4o', // use a larger model to evaluate
      schema: z.object({
        qualityScore: z.number().min(1).max(10),
        preservesTone: z.boolean(),
        preservesNuance: z.boolean(),
        culturallyAccurate: z.boolean(),
        specificIssues: z.array(z.string()),
        improvementSuggestions: z.array(z.string()),
      }),
      system: 'You are an expert in evaluating literary translations.',
      prompt: `Evaluate this translation:

      Original: ${text}
      Translation: ${currentTranslation}

      Consider:
      1. Overall quality
      2. Preservation of tone
      3. Preservation of nuance
      4. Cultural accuracy`,
    });

    // Check if quality meets threshold
    if (
      evaluation.qualityScore >= 8 &&
      evaluation.preservesTone &&
      evaluation.preservesNuance &&
      evaluation.culturallyAccurate
    ) {
      break;
    }

    // Generate improved translation based on feedback
    const { text: improvedTranslation } = await generateText({
      model: 'openai/gpt-4o', // use a larger model
      system: 'You are an expert literary translator.',
      prompt: `Improve this translation based on the following feedback:
      ${evaluation.specificIssues.join('\n')}
      ${evaluation.improvementSuggestions.join('\n')}

      Original: ${text}
      Current Translation: ${currentTranslation}`,
    });

    currentTranslation = improvedTranslation;
    iterations++;
  }

  return {
    finalTranslation: currentTranslation,
    iterationsRequired: iterations,
  };
}
```

title: Agent Class
description: Learn how to build agents with the Agent class.

# Agent Class

The Agent class provides a structured way to encapsulate LLM configuration, tools, and behavior into reusable components. It handles the agent loop for you, allowing the LLM to call tools multiple times in sequence to accomplish complex tasks. Define agents once and use them across your application.

## Why Use the Agent Class?

When building AI applications, you often need to:

- **Reuse configurations** - Same model settings, tools, and prompts across different parts of your application
- **Maintain consistency** - Ensure the same behavior and capabilities throughout your codebase
- **Simplify API routes** - Reduce boilerplate in your endpoints
- **Type safety** - Get full TypeScript support for your agent's tools and outputs

The Agent class provides a single place to define your agent's behavior.

## Creating an Agent

Define an agent by instantiating the Agent class with your desired configuration:

```ts
import { Experimental_Agent as Agent } from 'ai';

const myAgent = new Agent({
  model: 'openai/gpt-4o',
  system: 'You are a helpful assistant.',
  tools: {
    // Your tools here
  },
});
```

## Configuration Options

The Agent class accepts all the same settings as `generateText` and `streamText`. Configure:

### Model and System Prompt

```ts
import { Experimental_Agent as Agent } from 'ai';

const agent = new Agent({
  model: 'openai/gpt-4o',
  system: 'You are an expert software engineer.',
});
```

### Tools

Provide tools that the agent can use to accomplish tasks:

```ts
import { Experimental_Agent as Agent, tool } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

const codeAgent = new Agent({
  model: 'openai/gpt-4o',
  tools: {
    runCode: tool({
      description: 'Execute Python code',
      inputSchema: z.object({
        code: z.string(),
      }),
      execute: async ({ code }) => {
        // Execute code and return result
        return { output: 'Code executed successfully' };
      },
    }),
  },
});
```

### Loop Control

By default, agents run for only one step. In each step, the model either generates text or calls a tool. If it generates text, the agent completes. If it calls a tool, the AI SDK executes that tool.

To let agents call multiple tools in sequence, configure `stopWhen` to allow more steps. After each tool execution, the agent triggers a new generation where the model can call another tool or generate text:

```ts
import { Experimental_Agent as Agent, stepCountIs } from 'ai';

const agent = new Agent({
  model: 'openai/gpt-4o',
  stopWhen: stepCountIs(10), // Allow up to 10 steps
});
```

Each step represents one generation (which results in either text or a tool call). The loop continues until:

- The model generates text instead of calling a tool, or
- A stop condition is met

You can combine multiple conditions:

```ts
import { Experimental_Agent as Agent, stepCountIs } from 'ai';

const agent = new Agent({
  model: 'openai/gpt-4o',
  stopWhen: [
    stepCountIs(10), // Maximum 10 steps
    yourCustomCondition(), // Custom logic for when to stop
  ],
});
```

Learn more about [loop control and stop conditions](/docs/agents/loop-control).

### Tool Choice

Control how the agent uses tools:

```ts
import { Experimental_Agent as Agent } from 'ai';

const agent = new Agent({
  model: 'openai/gpt-4o',
  tools: {
    // your tools here
  },
  toolChoice: 'required', // Force tool use
  // or toolChoice: 'none' to disable tools
  // or toolChoice: 'auto' (default) to let the model decide
});
```

You can also force the use of a specific tool:

```ts
import { Experimental_Agent as Agent } from 'ai';

const agent = new Agent({
  model: 'openai/gpt-4o',
  tools: {
    weather: weatherTool,
    cityAttractions: attractionsTool,
  },
  toolChoice: {
    type: 'tool',
    toolName: 'weather', // Force the weather tool to be used
  },
});
```

### Structured Output

Define structured output schemas:

```ts
import { Experimental_Agent as Agent, Output, stepCountIs } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

const analysisAgent = new Agent({
  model: 'openai/gpt-4o',
  experimental_output: Output.object({
    schema: z.object({
      sentiment: z.enum(['positive', 'neutral', 'negative']),
      summary: z.string(),
      keyPoints: z.array(z.string()),
    }),
  }),
  stopWhen: stepCountIs(10),
});

const { experimental_output: output } = await analysisAgent.generate({
  prompt: 'Analyze customer feedback from the last quarter',
});
```

## Define Agent Behavior with System Prompts

System prompts define your agent's behavior, personality, and constraints. They set the context for all interactions and guide how the agent responds to user queries and uses tools.

### Basic System Prompts

Set the agent's role and expertise:

```ts
const agent = new Agent({
  model: 'openai/gpt-4o',
  system:
    'You are an expert data analyst. You provide clear insights from complex data.',
});
```

### Detailed Behavioral Instructions

Provide specific guidelines for agent behavior:

```ts
const codeReviewAgent = new Agent({
  model: 'openai/gpt-4o',
  system: `You are a senior software engineer conducting code reviews.

  Your approach:
  - Focus on security vulnerabilities first
  - Identify performance bottlenecks
  - Suggest improvements for readability and maintainability
  - Be constructive and educational in your feedback
  - Always explain why something is an issue and how to fix it`,
});
```

### Constrain Agent Behavior

Set boundaries and ensure consistent behavior:

```ts
const customerSupportAgent = new Agent({
  model: 'openai/gpt-4o',
  system: `You are a customer support specialist for an e-commerce platform.

  Rules:
  - Never make promises about refunds without checking the policy
  - Always be empathetic and professional
  - If you don't know something, say so and offer to escalate
  - Keep responses concise and actionable
  - Never share internal company information`,
  tools: {
    checkOrderStatus,
    lookupPolicy,
    createTicket,
  },
});
```

### Tool Usage Instructions

Guide how the agent should use available tools:

```ts
const researchAgent = new Agent({
  model: 'openai/gpt-4o',
  system: `You are a research assistant with access to search and document tools.

  When researching:
  1. Always start with a broad search to understand the topic
  2. Use document analysis for detailed information
  3. Cross-reference multiple sources before drawing conclusions
  4. Cite your sources when presenting information
  5. If information conflicts, present both viewpoints`,
  tools: {
    webSearch,
    analyzeDocument,
    extractQuotes,
  },
});
```

### Format and Style Instructions

Control the output format and communication style:

```ts
const technicalWriterAgent = new Agent({
  model: 'openai/gpt-4o',
  system: `You are a technical documentation writer.

  Writing style:
  - Use clear, simple language
  - Avoid jargon unless necessary
  - Structure information with headers and bullet points
  - Include code examples where relevant
  - Write in second person ("you" instead of "the user")

  Always format responses in Markdown.`,
});
```

## Using an Agent

Once defined, you can use your agent in three ways:

### Generate Text

Use `generate()` for one-time text generation:

```ts
const result = await myAgent.generate({
  prompt: 'What is the weather like?',
});

console.log(result.text);
```

### Stream Text

Use `stream()` for streaming responses:

```ts
const stream = myAgent.stream({
  prompt: 'Tell me a story',
});

for await (const chunk of stream.textStream) {
  console.log(chunk);
}
```

### Respond to UI Messages

Use `respond()` to create API responses for client applications:

```ts
// In your API route (e.g., app/api/chat/route.ts)
import { validateUIMessages } from 'ai';

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const { messages } = await request.json();

  return myAgent.respond({
    messages: await validateUIMessages({ messages }),
  });
}
```

## End-to-end Type Safety

You can infer types for your Agent's `UIMessage`s:

```ts
import {
  Experimental_Agent as Agent,
  Experimental_InferAgentUIMessage as InferAgentUIMessage,
} from 'ai';

const myAgent = new Agent({
  // ... configuration
});

// Infer the UIMessage type for UI components or persistence
export type MyAgentUIMessage = InferAgentUIMessage<typeof myAgent>;
```

Use this type in your client components with `useChat`:

```tsx filename="components/chat.tsx"
'use client';

import { useChat } from '@ai-sdk/react';
import type { MyAgentUIMessage } from '@/agent/my-agent';

export function Chat() {
  const { messages } = useChat<MyAgentUIMessage>();
  // Full type safety for your messages and tools
}
```

## Next Steps

description: Control agent execution with built-in loop management using stopWhen and prepareStep

# Loop Control

When building agents with the AI SDK, you can control both the execution flow and the settings at each step of the agent loop. The AI SDK provides built-in loop control through two parameters: `stopWhen` for defining stopping conditions and `prepareStep` for modifying settings (model, tools, messages, and more) between steps.

Both parameters work with:

- `generateText` and `streamText` functions from AI SDK Core
- The `Agent` class for object-oriented agent implementations

## Stop Conditions

The `stopWhen` parameter controls when to stop the generation when there are tool results in the last step. By default, the stopping condition is `stepCountIs(1)`, which allows only a single step.

When you provide `stopWhen`, the AI SDK continues generating responses after tool calls until a stopping condition is met. When the condition is an array, the generation stops when any of the conditions are met.

### Use Built-in Conditions

The AI SDK provides several built-in stopping conditions:

```ts
import { generateText, stepCountIs } from 'ai';

const result = await generateText({
  model: 'openai/gpt-4o',
  tools: {
    // your tools
  },
  stopWhen: stepCountIs(10), // Stop after 10 steps maximum
  prompt: 'Analyze this dataset and create a summary report',
});
```

### Combine Multiple Conditions

Combine multiple stopping conditions. The loop stops when it meets any condition:

```ts
import { generateText, stepCountIs, hasToolCall } from 'ai';

const result = await generateText({
  model: 'openai/gpt-4o',
  tools: {
    // your tools
  },
  stopWhen: [
    stepCountIs(10), // Maximum 10 steps
    hasToolCall('someTool'), // Stop after calling 'someTool'
  ],
  prompt: 'Research and analyze the topic',
});
```

### Create Custom Conditions

Build custom stopping conditions for specific requirements:

```ts
import { generateText, StopCondition, ToolSet } from 'ai';

const tools = {
  // your tools
} satisfies ToolSet;

const hasAnswer: StopCondition<typeof tools> = ({ steps }) => {
  // Stop when the model generates text containing "ANSWER:"
  return steps.some(step => step.text?.includes('ANSWER:')) ?? false;
};

const result = await generateText({
  model: 'openai/gpt-4o',
  tools,
  stopWhen: hasAnswer,
  prompt: 'Find the answer and respond with "ANSWER: [your answer]"',
});
```

Custom conditions receive step information across all steps:

```ts
const budgetExceeded: StopCondition<typeof tools> = ({ steps }) => {
  const totalUsage = steps.reduce(
    (acc, step) => ({
      inputTokens: acc.inputTokens + (step.usage?.inputTokens ?? 0),
      outputTokens: acc.outputTokens + (step.usage?.outputTokens ?? 0),
    }),
    { inputTokens: 0, outputTokens: 0 },
  );

  const costEstimate =
    (totalUsage.inputTokens * 0.01 + totalUsage.outputTokens * 0.03) / 1000;
  return costEstimate > 0.5; // Stop if cost exceeds $0.50
};
```

## Prepare Step

The `prepareStep` callback runs before each step in the loop and defaults to the initial settings if you don't return any changes. Use it to modify settings, manage context, or implement dynamic behavior based on execution history.

### Dynamic Model Selection

Switch models based on step requirements:

```ts
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const result = await generateText({
  model: 'openai/gpt-4o-mini', // Default model
  tools: {
    // your tools
  },
  prepareStep: async ({ stepNumber, messages }) => {
    // Use a stronger model for complex reasoning after initial steps
    if (stepNumber > 2 && messages.length > 10) {
      return {
        model: 'openai/gpt-4o',
      };
    }
    // Continue with default settings
    return {};
  },
});
```

### Context Management

Manage growing conversation history in long-running loops:

```ts
const result = await generateText({
  model: 'openai/gpt-4o',
  tools: {
    // your tools
  },
  prepareStep: async ({ messages }) => {
    // Keep only recent messages to stay within context limits
    if (messages.length > 20) {
      return {
        messages: [
          messages[0], // Keep system message
          ...messages.slice(-10), // Keep last 10 messages
        ],
      };
    }
    return {};
  },
});
```

### Tool Selection

Control which tools are available at each step:

```ts
const result = await generateText({
  model: 'openai/gpt-4o',
  tools: {
    search: searchTool,
    analyze: analyzeTool,
    summarize: summarizeTool,
  },
  prepareStep: async ({ stepNumber, steps }) => {
    // Search phase (steps 0-2)
    if (stepNumber <= 2) {
      return {
        activeTools: ['search'],
        toolChoice: 'required',
      };
    }

    // Analysis phase (steps 3-5)
    if (stepNumber <= 5) {
      return {
        activeTools: ['analyze'],
      };
    }

    // Summary phase (step 6+)
    return {
      activeTools: ['summarize'],
      toolChoice: 'required',
    };
  },
});
```

You can also force a specific tool to be used:

```ts
prepareStep: async ({ stepNumber }) => {
  if (stepNumber === 0) {
    // Force the search tool to be used first
    return {
      toolChoice: { type: 'tool', toolName: 'search' },
    };
  }

  if (stepNumber === 5) {
    // Force the summarize tool after analysis
    return {
      toolChoice: { type: 'tool', toolName: 'summarize' },
    };
  }

  return {};
};
```

### Message Modification

Transform messages before sending them to the model:

```ts
const result = await generateText({
  model: 'openai/gpt-4o',
  messages,
  tools: {
    // your tools
  },
  prepareStep: async ({ messages, stepNumber }) => {
    // Summarize tool results to reduce token usage
    const processedMessages = messages.map(msg => {
      if (msg.role === 'tool' && msg.content.length > 1000) {
        return {
          ...msg,
          content: summarizeToolResult(msg.content),
        };
      }
      return msg;
    });

    return { messages: processedMessages };
  },
});
```

## Access Step Information

Both `stopWhen` and `prepareStep` receive detailed information about the current execution:

```ts
prepareStep: async ({
  model, // Current model configuration
  stepNumber, // Current step number (0-indexed)
  steps, // All previous steps with their results
  messages, // Messages to be sent to the model
}) => {
  // Access previous tool calls and results
  const previousToolCalls = steps.flatMap(step => step.toolCalls);
  const previousResults = steps.flatMap(step => step.toolResults);

  // Make decisions based on execution history
  if (previousToolCalls.some(call => call.toolName === 'dataAnalysis')) {
    return {
      toolChoice: { type: 'tool', toolName: 'reportGenerator' },
    };
  }

  return {};
},
```

## Manual Loop Control

For scenarios requiring complete control over the agent loop, implement your own loop management instead of using `stopWhen` and `prepareStep`. This approach provides maximum flexibility for complex workflows.
